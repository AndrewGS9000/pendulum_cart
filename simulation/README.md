COMP0216: Systems Engineering for Real-time Systems, Milestone D, team 7, 3/2025


Instructions:

There are 3 different folders for our 3 different controllers: PID, LQR, and feedback linearization.

To run the code, open the folder of the controller you would like to run, and run the "simulator.py" file. (example: to run the PID controller, run "pid/simulator.py"). 
Depending on the controller and computer used, the file may take a moment to run.

Requirements:
- python 3.11.10
- Visual Studio Code (or another IDE for python)

libraries:
- numpy v1.26.4
- matplotlib v3.9.1
- scipy v1.14.1
